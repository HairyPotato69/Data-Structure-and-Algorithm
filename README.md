# Data Structure and Algorithm
This is my personal note on Data Strucutre and Algorithm or known by its alias DSA.

# Things to keep in mind
1. The language used is **C++** 
2. Since the notes are mainly for me (*it's really just for me*), so some parts may be difficult to understand.
3. These notes are written in Obsidian 
4. These notes are not complete, so there may be missing information that may be crucial in learning DSA, but I will be updating the notes regularly. 


The notes are not perfect and I am trying to tidy some things up (*I am messy with my notes*), but if these notes helps, feel free to explore and modify them however you like.
