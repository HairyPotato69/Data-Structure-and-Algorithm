# AVL Tree?
What is the need for an AVL tree? The issue with n-ary tree, binary tree, and binary search tree is that it may become unbalanced at any moment.
![[Tree or linked list]]
If a subtree is structured in this way, it essentially becomes a linked list. The time complexity would change from logarithmic time to linear time. So, computer scientists invented a self balancing binary search tree. Other than it's self balancing capability, the tree remains true to its typical characteristics and functionalities.
